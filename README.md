# ESP32-Webserver-RTOS-CS452
This program uses the ESP32, Vandaluino3 PCB and HDC1080 Temperature / Humidity Sensor to create a web server hosted by the ESP32.
The web page for the web server is created using the SPIFFS system using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 
Temperature and Humidity values are uploaded to the webpage where the current values are displayed in real time. 
This is implemented using the Arduino Framework through PlatformIO.

Created while attending CS452 at the University of Idaho.
